## Git Restore:
Git Restore is to undo your changes from either statging area or from working tree. It will move back all your changes from staging area to working tree or will completely remove from your working tree.

```
git restore --stage --> Moves back to working tree
git restore <path>  --> completely removes the changes from working tree.
```

Be cautious while performing git restore. Becuase it will remove all the changes from your working tree till to the previous commit.
