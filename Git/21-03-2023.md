# How to check the changes in Git.
- When ever you are doing any commits, as we are aware that there will few changes happen from once commit to another commit.
- Now if you want to see the changes from/between commits we have to follow the below strategy.
- There are two way to check the differences
    - First One: from Commits.
        - We can see the changes between two or more commits in two ways
             1) By Using commandline
                ```
                git diff <commit1> <commit2>
                ```
                ```
